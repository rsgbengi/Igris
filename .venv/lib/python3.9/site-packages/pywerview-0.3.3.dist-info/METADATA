## HISTORY

As a pentester, I love using PowerView during my assignments. It makes it so
easy to find vulnerable machines, or list what domain users were added to the
local Administrators group of a machine, and much more.

However, running PowerView on a computer which is not connected to the domain
is a pain: I always find myself using [mimikatz](https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz/)'s
`sekurlsa::pth` to run a Powershell prompt with stolen domain credentials, and
that's not easy to script. Plus, I'm a Linux guy and I've always found it a
shame that there were no complete Windows/Active Directory enumeration tool on
Linux.

That's why I decided to rewrite some of PowerView's functionalities in Python,
using the wonderful [impacket](https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket)
library.

*Update:* I haven't tested the last version of PowerView yet, which can run
from a machine not connected to a domain. I don't know if it works correctly
under Linux using Powershell. If anyone has had any experience with this at all,
you can contact me, I'm really interested. We'll see if pywerview has become
obsoleted ;) but I think I'll continue working on it eitherway: I'd still
rather use Python than Powershell on Linux, and I'm learning a lot! Plus, it
may integrated in existing Linux tools written in Python. It's still great news
that PowerView now supports machines not connected to the domain!

## DISCLAIMER

This tool is far from complete (as you'll see in the [TODO](#todo) section)! I
still have a lot more awesome PowerView functionalities to implement (the user
hunting functions, the GPO functions, the local process enumeration, etc.),
but I still think it can be useful as is.

It's also (very) possible that there are (many) bugs in the code: I've only
tested the simplest test cases. If you use this tool during an assignment and
you get an error, please, open an issue with the error and the conditions that
triggered this error.

Also, blah blah blah, don't use it for evil purposes.

Take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/the-useless-one/pywerview/wiki) to
see a more detailed usage of every command.

*Attention:* in every command, the used domain name must be the post-Win2k UPN,
and not the Win2k compatible name.

For example, my domain name is `uselessdomain.local`. The Win2K compatible name
is `USELESSDOMAIN`. In every command,  I must use __`uselessdomain.local`__ as
an argument, and __not__ `USELESSDOMAIN`.

## TODO

* Many, many more PowerView functionalities to implement. I'll now focus on
  forest functions, then inter-forest trust functions
* Lots of rewrite due to the last version of PowerView
* Implement a debugging mode (for easier troubleshooting)
* Gracefully fail against Unix machines running Samba
* Support Kerberos authentication
* Perform range cycling in `get-netgroupmember`
* Manage request to the Global Catalog
* Try to fall back to `tcp/139` for RPC communications if `tcp/445` is closed
* Comment, document, and clean the code
